For example, <code>'0010e2' == '1e3'</code> will return <code>true</code> as both variables are considered as an integer, where the “e” is the sign for exponential (so both are considered “1” as an integer).</p>\n<p>Based on this interesting behaviour, we can see that the admin hash matches the property, where it could be considered as <code>0 ^ 462096931906507119562988736854</code> which is just “0”. Therefore, any string that produces a hash that starts with <code>0e</code> will be considered the same as the admin hash.</p>\n<p>From this payload example list (<a href=\"https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Type%20Juggling/README.md#magic-hashes\">https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Type Juggling/README.md#magic-hashes</a>), there are different “magic hashes” that can achieve the same goal.</p>\n<p>Using the string<code>\"240610708\"</code> as the password, we are able to login to the admin account.\n<img src=\"./Screenshots/image_7.png\" alt=\"Screenshots\"></p>\n<p>On the admin page, there is a new page that allows user to upload a file by providing a remote URL to download the image.\n<img src=\"./Screenshots/image_8.png\" alt=\"Screenshots\"></p>\n<p>By putting in a valid URL, it shows the command that was used to obtain the image.\n<img src=\"./Screenshots/image_9.png\" alt=\"Screenshots\">\nThis suggests 2 possible vulnerabilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>OS command injection</li>\n<li>Insecure file upload</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After some testing, it seems that OS command injection is not possible as all special characters are properly sanatized before being executed.</p>\n<p>Through some fuzzing, it was found that only the following extensions are allowed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.png</li>\n<li>.jpg</li>\n<li>.gif</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From here, I have been trying to use different filter bypass techniques such as null byte poisoning, double extension to upload a PHP file for code execution.
